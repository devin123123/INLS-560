# Basic Math Data Types in Python

In Python, there are several fundamental data types used for mathematical operations. Below are the most common ones:

## 1. Integers (`int`)
- **Definition**: Whole numbers without a decimal point (e.g., `5`, `-10`, `42`).
- **Use Cases**: Useful for counting, indexing, or any scenario where fractions are not needed.
- **Example**:
  ```python
  x = 10
  y = -5
  print(x + y)  # Output: 5
